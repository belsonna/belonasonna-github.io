## About Me
I am a PhD student in the [Humanizing Machine Intelligence](https://hmi.anu.edu.au/) group at the **Australian National University**, where my research focuses on the **formal verification of AI ethics principles in AI decision processes**. I am honoured to be supervised by [Dr. Alban Grastien](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/alban-grastien/), [Prof. Lexing Xie](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/index.html), and [Dr. Michael Norrish](https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/michael-norrish).

My work aims to design **assessment frameworks based on formal abductive explanations** to audit **proxy discrimination**, **unfairness**, and **privacy leakage** in AI decisions. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to **healthcare systems**, where ensuring trustworthy AI is critical for real-world impact.

Outside my PhD research, I have served since 2022 as a **Responsible AI panelist** for the [Responsible AI Initiative](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/) led by the [MIT Sloan Management Review](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/), where, together with other panelists, we examine how organizations are developing responsible AI practices, policies, and standards.

Previously, I worked as an **Associate AI Engineer at [Future](https://www.future.co.jp/en/)** in Tokyo, developing deep learning models for **early dementia detection using eye-gaze analysis**. I also served as a **Research Intern at the [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/)**, where I investigated the **social impacts of AI**. I was part of the first cohort of the [African Master’s in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) program in Rwanda, and I hold a **Master’s in Computer Science from the Université de Ngaoundéré**.

Beyond research, I actively advocate for **expanding access to AI and STEM education** among underrepresented communities, especially in Africa. I am the **Founder and Co-lead of [Bel’s AI Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bel-s-ai-initiative/)**, which conducts bilingual (English and French) AI outreach in Central Africa with a focus on rural areas. I am also a member of [AfroLeadership](https://afroleadership.org/), the [WIMLDS Yaoundé](http://wimlds.org/about-the-yaounde-team-2/) chapter, and a co-organizer of [KMERAI](https://sites.google.com/view/kmerai-2021/home?authuser=0) events.

I have been recognized among the [100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics™ – 2022](https://womeninaiethics.org/the-list/of-2022/) and the [80 African women advancing Artificial Intelligence in Africa and around the world](https://africanshapers.com/en/80-african-women-advancing-artificial-intelligence-in-africa-and-the-world/).
