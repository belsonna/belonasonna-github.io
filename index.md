## About Me
I am a PhD Candidate in the [Humanizing Machine Intelligence](https://hmi.anu.edu.au/) group at the **Australian National University**, where my research focuses on the **formal verification of AI ethics principles in AI decision processes**. I am honoured to be supervised by [Dr. Alban Grastien](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/alban-grastien/), [Prof. Lexing Xie](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/index.html), and [Dr. Michael Norrish](https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/michael-norrish).

My current work aims to design **assessment frameworks based on formal abductive explanations** to audit **proxy discrimination**, **unfairness**, and **privacy leakage** in AI decisions. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to **healthcare systems**, where ensuring trustworthy AI is critical for real-world impact.

Beyond research, I actively advocate for **expanding access to AI and STEM education** among underrepresented communities, especially in Africa. I am the **Founder and Co-lead of [Bel’s AI Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bel-s-ai-initiative/)**, which conducts bilingual (English and French) AI outreach in Central Africa with a focus on rural areas. I am also a member of [AfroLeadership](https://afroleadership.org/), the [WIMLDS Yaoundé](http://wimlds.org/about-the-yaounde-team-2/) chapter, and a co-organizer of [KMERAI](https://sites.google.com/view/kmerai-2021/home?authuser=0) events.

I have been recognized among the [Top 40 under 40 African AI Achievers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/society-for-ai_ai40under40-africanaisummit-activity-7395416482526142464-zOql?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAB2_j58BZ0lhOJB8dtUXWivqrgWvl2Vcdqo), the  [100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics™ – 2022](https://womeninaiethics.org/the-list/of-2022/) and the [80 African women advancing Artificial Intelligence in Africa and around the world](https://africanshapers.com/en/80-african-women-advancing-artificial-intelligence-in-africa-and-the-world/).
