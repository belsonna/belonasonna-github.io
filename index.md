## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student researching how **formal abductive explanations** can help detect bias and unfairness in AI-based decision-making systems. My work focuses on bridging **explainable AI** with **ethical auditing frameworks**, with applications in workplace mental health, diversity, and high-stakes decision processes.
